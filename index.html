<p>This project is a game of air hockey with a human facing off against a robot player. The robot, mounted on top of the air hockey "table," will block and return a puck launched by the human player. Computer vision is utilized to compute the trajectory of the incoming puck in real-time, while a motor-operated paddle deflects the ball. <br><br>

Our initial design came from the simple idea of having a robot blocking/hitting a ball back to a person. From this, the air hockey idea was elaborated upon and more research was conducted to get the specificities to put the idea into actuality. From our research, <a href="http://jjrobots.com/air-hockey-robot-a-3d-printer-hack/">one other person</a> has done a similar project using a 3D printer for parts. We used this as a good reference on how to implement our own designs.</p>

<h3>
</span></a>Mechanics for the Robot</h3>

<p>The system consists of a linear slide rail with a sliding carriage attached to a timing belt. The timing belt runs around a pulley system (two individual pulleys) at either end of the rail. This is driven by a stepper motor, chosen for its ability to run in two directions quickly and accurately. As the motor runs, the driving pulley and the idler pulley both spin, pulling the carriage along with it, ultimately moving the robot side-to-side.

The paddle is powered by a push-pull solenoid. It is supported by two guide rails that slide in and out along with the solenoid as the paddle is pushed forward. The paddle itself hangs below the linear slide rail to allow space for the puck to pass under the whole robot, in case the player wins.</p>

<h3>
</span></a>Computer Vision</h3>

<p>Here is the goal of our initial vision code. We want to be able to detect the different pucks, which are represented by different colored circles. The two blue circles represent the "goal" and the location of the frame for the robot. <br><br>

Based on the position of the incoming "pucks" our robot goalie will predict the trajectory of the pucks and react accordingly to block the puck from the goal.</p>
